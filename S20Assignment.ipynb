    "### **Part 1: Properties and Property Decorators**  \n",
    "Create a `Person` class with the following features:\n",
    "1. **Dynamic Age Property**:  \n",
    "   - Implement an `age` property. The age should not be stored directly but should be calculated based on the birth year and the current year using a dynamic property.\n",
    "   - Provide a `set_birth_year` setter that allows modifying the birth year and updates the `age` accordingly.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Full Name Property**:  \n",
    "   - Implement a property `full_name` that combines `first_name` and `last_name`.\n",
    "   - Add a setter for `full_name` that splits a full name string into `first_name` and `last_name` and updates both attributes.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Computed Property with Validation**:  \n",
    "   - Implement a `salary` property that computes the salary based on `base_salary` and an annual bonus percentage (given as a property `bonus`).\n",
    "   - The salary should update automatically when either `base_salary` or `bonus` changes.\n",
    "   - Add validation that the bonus percentage is between 0 and 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Read-only Property for Current Year**:  \n",
    "   - Implement a `current_year` property that returns the current year and is read-only.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Part 2: Read-Only and Computed Properties**  \n",
    "1. **Circle Class**:  \n",
    "   - Implement a `Circle` class with properties for `radius` and `diameter` (calculated property).\n",
    "   - The `diameter` property should be computed as `2 * radius`, but the `radius` itself should be mutable.\n",
    "   - Add a `set_radius` setter that recalculates the `diameter` and `area` whenever the radius is updated.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Circle Area (Cached)**:  \n",
    "   - Implement the `area` of the circle as a computed property.\n",
    "   - Cache the computed area to avoid recalculating it every time the `area` property is accessed.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Validation in Computed Properties**:  \n",
    "   - Ensure that the `radius` is always a positive number. If it's set to a negative value, raise a `ValueError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Part 3: Class and Static Methods with Complex Use Cases**  \n",
    "1. **Vehicle Class**:  \n",
    "   - Create a `Vehicle` class with a class-level variable `vehicle_count` that tracks the total number of `Vehicle` instances.\n",
    "   - Implement a class method `get_vehicle_count` that returns the current count.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Static Method for Vehicle Classification**:  \n",
    "   - Add a static method `classify_vehicle` that takes a string (`\"car\"`, `\"truck\"`, `\"motorcycle\"`) and returns a message like: `\"This is a car\"` or `\"This is a truck\"`.\n",
    "   - This static method should not require any class or instance-specific data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Inheritance and Static Methods**:  \n",
    "   - Create a subclass `ElectricVehicle` that inherits from `Vehicle`.\n",
    "   - Override the `classify_vehicle` method to reflect that the vehicle is electric.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Part 4: Class Body Scope and Dynamic Behavior**  \n",
    "1. **Advanced Class Body Scope**:  \n",
    "   - Create a `DynamicClass` class with a class-level variable `static_value`.\n",
    "   - Define an `__init__` method that allows the dynamic creation of attributes.\n",
    "   - Implement a method `dynamic_attr` that dynamically adds attributes to an instance at runtime.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Descriptor Protocol**:  \n",
    "   - Implement a `ValidatedAttribute` descriptor that validates the value before setting it.\n",
    "   - The `ValidatedAttribute` descriptor should ensure that any attribute set to this descriptor is always a positive integer.\n",
    "\n",
